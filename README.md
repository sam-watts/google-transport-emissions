[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://transport-co2-emissions.streamlit.app/)

:wave: Welcome! This app lets you see the approximate carbon footprint (as CO2eq) of your
travel, based on your Google location data. This works best if you have an
Android phone, and have had location history enabled for at least a few months
(ideally years!)
